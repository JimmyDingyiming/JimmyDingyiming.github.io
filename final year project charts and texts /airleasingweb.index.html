    <h1>HK aircraft leasing has further potential to grow despite competition</h1>
    <p>Reporter: Jimmy Ding</p>

    <body>
        <p>Hong Kong would face competition from mainland China in aircraft leasing, while mainland was advised to loosen its customs rules to facilitate aircraft leasing business, advised expert. </p>
        <p>SAR has put much effort on promoting itself as a world aircraft leasing hub. However, mainland China also targets at this market, aiming to expand its market share. SCMP reported around 1,000 planes - is now handled in China between Shanghai,
            Shenzhen and the Dongjiang free trade zone in Tianjin.</p>

        </responsive-block>
        <p>"Now it is not only Tianjin fueled its leasing business, other second-tier cities like Xi'an, Xiamen and Zhengzhou are also eyeing for a big chunk of the aircraft leasing market. However, Tianjin starts earlier than other cities which is a major
            reason why it retains its leading position," said Johnny Lau, chief consulting aviation business services in PwC Hong Kong.</p>

        <p>Lau said to prosper mainland aircraft leasing market, there are two aspects that the government could take into consideration. "Aircraft leasing is policy-driven sector. The export and import of aircraft are always restricted by Chinese customs
            in many different ways. Mainland government can loosen the policy to flourish air leasing market." </p>
        <p>"The other restraint is from currency perspective. Aircraft are normally dollar-based assets. While if you are using yuan to calculate their value, they may suffer exchange loss risk," said Lau. </p>
        <p>Equipped with mature law and financial system, Hong Kong can still grab a big market share in aircraft leasing business notwithstanding the fact that it is in the competition with mainland China. </p>
        <p>"If the government's support continues to be sufficient, I am pretty confident Hong Kong can develop its aircraft leasing business well based on the fact that it is an international financial center and several leasing companies listed in Hong
            Kong can provide their services," Lau said. </p>
        <img src="../final images/BOC.jpg" style="width:100%" alt="" />
        <p>
            <font size="1">BOC Aviation is the listed aircraft leasing company in Hong Kong. Its parent company is BOC</font>
        </p>
        <p>According to the second half of 2018 result published by two listed companies, Bank of China Aviation (2588) and China Aircraft Lease (2006), BOC Aviation recorded a leverage ratio 76.69% while China Aircraft Lease is even higher, 91.2%. The dividend
            payout for both companies is more than 20%. </p>
        <p>Although the leverage is high, the liquidity seems not a bother for leasing companies. Lau explained "the lessors do not need to repay their debts immediately since their assets are huge and the high leverage ratio is not a big concern."</p>

        <p>The cost of capital for aircraft lessors is lower than airlines. Lau said "lessors borrow money from the bank and since the lessor is heavy-asset based company, the bank is quite confident to lend money to those lessors. Once they default, the
            lessors could still sell their aircraft. The liquidity maybe an obstacle for airlines but not for leasing companies."</p>
        <p>However, whether high leverage ratio can be seen as normal is challenged by different views. "Cash flow is the key for heavy-asset based companies. It will be better for companies to reduce their high leverage ratios," said assistant professor
            Duan Yang, department of finance and decision science in Hong Kong Baptist University. </p>
        <p>To build Hong Kong into an aircraft leasing hub, the government cut its corporate tax rate to 8.25% for the assessable profits of aircraft lessors in 2017, half of its original level. Another measure is lessors will be taxed on 20 per cent of
            their gross leasing income less deductible expenses.</p>

        <p>"Aircraft leasing business is a huge market and Hong Kong government has already taken notice of it," said Lau. He added the government's change of the bill has stoked the start of aircraft leasing business in Hong Kong. "We got a project thanks
            to the new bill which lowered taxes and benefits the whole sector," Lau added. </p>
        <p>Lau said "Hong Kong's law and financial systems have laid a solid foundation for the growth of airline leasing in Hong Kong. The policy is also making a positive effect on the business." </p>
        <p>The core business model of an aircraft lessor is focused on purchasing new, fuel-efficient, in-demand aircraft at competitive prices directly from manufacturers, financing purchases efficiently, leasing aircraft to global customers. Lau said the
            return from the aircraft leasing is normally a percentage of high single digit. </p>


        <p>Different from purchasing an aircraft which usually last for 4 to 5 years, aircraft leasing is much faster. Airlines are also bothered with their old aircraft. Lau said "Once the aircraft have finished services, it is troublesome for airlines
            to deal with these aircraft. The easier way is to rent an aircraft and that is another reason air leasing has a huge market."</p>
        <p>Comparing to purchasing an aircraft directly from Boeing or Airbus, aircraft leasing requires less capital. "Even if you are financing from banks, 20% or 30% value of an aircraft is still a huge amount for banks to lend. However, with aircraft
            leasing, you just need to pay six-month rent as deposits which airlines can definitely afford," Lau said. </p>
        <p>Lau said, "normally, the leasing price is decided by negotiation of two parties and the age of the aircraft. When we call an aircraft old, it is probably more than 40 years and the price is relatively lower comparing to other aircraft." </p>
        <p>The leasing market is a growing pie. According to Hong Kong government statistics, the proportion of new aircraft being financed by leasing rose from less than 1% 40 years ago to about 32% in 2011 and the trend is to grow to around 40% by 2020.
        </p>
        <p>There are around 11,000 to 12,000 aircraft leasing every year by global airlines, with Ireland taking the crown of the market up to 65 per cent, after being in the business for 40 years. </p>

            <p>Ireland, known as a nation of aviators, its low corporate tax regime and extensive double tax treaty network have long been credited with underpinning the aviation finance sector here. </p>
            <p>Singapore seized the second place of the leasing business, taking around 20 per cent of the global market, after being in the business for two decades. Hong Kong is aiming for the crumbs at third place. </p>
            <p>The SAR estimated the market share of Hong Kong in global aircraft leasing business will reach 18% in the next two decades. Hong Kong Financial Services Development Council projected the financial leasing will be 3,240 aircraft valued at HK$700
                billion, with the potential to create 15,340 jobs over 20 years. </p>
