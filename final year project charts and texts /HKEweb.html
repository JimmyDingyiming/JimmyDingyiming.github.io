    <h1>Cathay's dominance will not level up airfare </h1>
    <p>Reporter: Jimmy Ding</p>
    <p>Although Cathay's ongoing acquisition signifies its supreme position in Hong Kong airline market, analysts expected Cathay would not raise airfare since it could distort the synergy from the acquisition. </p>
    <p>
        "If the deal gets approved, people do not need to worry airfare will go up since HK Express (HKE) was bought for Cathay to expand its budget airline market," said Dr. Law Cheung-kwok, director of aviation policy and research center in Chinese University
        of Hong Kong said "
    </p>
    <p>
        Curtis Yeung, securities analyst said "The market position for Cathay and HKE are different. If airfare is raised, it will weaken the synergy generated from this deal."
    </p>

    <p>Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon control around 45% slots in Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), operating 201 passenger and cargo planes in total, with 232 destinations in 53 countries and territories. While HKE takes around 5% of HKIA runway
        slots, flying to 24 Asian destinations and operates 24 planes. The acquisition enhanced Cathay's dominance at the Hong Kong International Airport.

            <div class="column">
                <iframe src="XRL.html" width="110%" height="480px" frameborder="0" align="left"></iframe>

            <div class="column">

    <p>
        Yeung said, "Although Cathay may dominate the routes from Hong Kong to Japan and it will gain around half of the parking slots in Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), it may not lead to monopoly."
    </p>
    <p>
        Law said, "Cathay acquired HKE because it believes the budget airline market has a bright future in Hong Kong and Cathay hopes to tap into this market."
    </p>
    <h2>Cathay's march into budget airline market</h2>
    <p>
        Cathay described the acquisition as capturing a unique market segment. Cathay said in the statement "This represents an attractive and practical way for the Cathay Group to support the long-term development and growth of our aviation business and to enhance
        the competitiveness of the Hong Kong hub during a time of intense regional competition."
    </p>
    <iframe src="HKE.html" , width="100%" , frameborder="0" , height="400px"></iframe>
    <p>
        Yeung said, "HKE itself is already a mature brand and it does not need too much input from Cathay Pacific. If the price and acquisition scale are reasonable, it will help Cathay to obtain a bigger market share in terms of passengers, airline routes and
        airport slots. As for branding, Cathay targeted at middle to high level customer services which complemented HKE's brand position."
    </p>
    <p>
        The spokesman from Cathay said people have demands for budget airlines. The operation model of HKE can compensate the operation model held by Cathay Pacific. Cathay believed HKE can adapt to Cathay's network and it will fuel greater growth for HKE. Cathay
        said HKE will continue to operate as a stand-alone budget airline.
    </p>
    <h2>Budget airline market in Hong Kong</h2>
    <p>
        Law said the growth of budget airline market in Hong Kong is relatively slow. In Europe and the US, the budget airline market takes around 40% of the whole airline market while in Asia is around 20% to 30%. "Hong Kong only has 12% to 13% market share
        for budget airlines, in the long term, the growth is huge," said Law.
    </p>
    <p>
        Law expected the growth of budget airline market in Hong Kong to unleash when the third runway is finished. "Because the capacity of HKIA is limited by its current two runways. The growth for low cost carrier will accelerate when the third runway operates,"
        said Law.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cathay announced its acquisition plan of HK Express (HKE, a budget airline in Hong Kong), with a deal made at HK$4.93 billion. Cathay said in a statement in Hong Kong Stock Exchange the buying price comprises HK$2.25 billion of cash and HK$2.68 billion
        of non-cash consideration through promissory loan notes. The deal is to be completed by the end of 2019.
    </p>
    <iframe src="HKE2.html" width=100%, height="500px" , frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>However, the price Cathay offered is more than it had expected. HKE reported a net loss of HK$141 million in 2018 and a net asset value of HK1.12 billion. The price Cathay paid is four times greater than HKE net asset. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America
        Merrill Lynch all said Cathay Pacific had offered too much.

    </p>
    <h2>What you need to know about HKE</h2>
    <p>
        HKE is under HNA, the indebted giant, to Cathay. HKE turned into a low-cost carrier since 2013. It currently has 24 operating fleet includes Airbus A320, A320-neo and A321 aircraft, all of which are designed as economy class layout.


    </p>
    <p>HKE is the only Hong Kong-based low-cost carrier so far. HKE stepped into swamp last year due to high yield to maturity which reached 12.5% on December 2018. Investors doubt its ability to pay back the debt. HKE issued US$60 million puttable bond
        in 2017 with 3 years maturity. The acquisition led by Cathay assuaged people's fear on HKE's bankruptcy.

    </p>
    <p>
        The legal lawsuit filed by Zhong Guosong, executive chairman and the largest shareholder of HKE may chock the acquisition process. Zhong said he is reluctant to sell HKE. The deal between Cathay and HKE is still ongoing.
