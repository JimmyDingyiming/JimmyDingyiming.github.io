    <h1>Airfares may rise as shortage occurs </h1>
    <p>Reporter: Jimmy Ding</p>
    <p>According to Fitch report, airfares in the second quarter may rise as seasonal demand picks up while the grounding of Boeing 737 Max reduces the supply. </p>
    <p>The report stated, "the airlines that do not rely on Boeing 737 Max planes may benefit as competitors struggle to replace their grounded fleet with other models, for which leasing rates are likely to increase, pushing airfares upwards."</p>
    <p>However, whether there will be a rise in airfares is viewed differently. Iran Douglas, senior lecturer in school of aviation, university of Sydney said "In the short term the issue is a small dip in capacity despite the fact that the grounding of
        Boeing 737 Max. Even if the grounding is extended, this can be mitigated by retaining aircraft that were due to be retired or returned to leasing companies. The small capacity impact is unlikely to have a measurable change in pricing across the
        broader market." </p>
    <iframe src="../aircrash.html" width="100%" frameborder='0' height='500px'></iframe>
    <p>Douglas said, "Airline companies may change the orders for the Max, while in the short term it is more about adjusting slightly reduced global capacity." Boeing only received 32 new orders in the first three months of 2019, a sharp fall from 122 the
        same period last year. Boeing also cut down its production of Max 737 planes from 52 a month to 42. According to US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), there are around 350 Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft in operation worldwide. While Boeing holds
        around 5,000 737 Max backlog orders on its books.

    </p>
    <h2>Air crash stoked fear on Boeing </h2>
    <p>
        Ethiopian and Indonesia Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed within just five months, sending a warning signal to Boeing airplanes' safety issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        With China leading the ground of 737 MAX 8, many countries followed. Boeing, the largest American airplane manufacture was trapped in the gridlock. China's suspension on Boeing 737 MAX 8 had a great effect on Boeing since China is one of the major market
        Boeing targeted. According to data from Cirium, Boeing has delivered 356 of its 737 MAX. China currently have 97 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes, the most in the globe. Boeing estimated China is going to be the biggest aviation market with market scale
        exceeding US$1 trillion. In 2037, China will need 7690 airplanes to meet the demand.

    <p>
        Assistant professor Peng Lu in Aeronautical and aviation engineering Hong Kong Polytechnic University said travelers' confidence maybe dented by the safety issue but only in a short term. Chris Higgins, analyst from Morningstar said if the grounding last
        90 days, Boeing might lose US$2.5 billion. Boeing suspended its delivery process of Max 737 and it planned to cut down its Max737 production by 20 percent.


    </p>
    <h2>
        Economic loss of Boeing
    </h2>
    <p>Bloomberg data showed the estimated cost of lawsuits and reimbursements could add to $1.9 billion in just six months.
    </p>
    <p>Many airline carriers issued warnings about their profits hit by the global grounding of Boeing 737 MAX fleet. Robert Stallard in Vertical Partners Research said, "They can in theory switch orders from Boeing to Airbus, but they will be waiting at
        the back of the Airbus queue." It is highly unlikely for airline companies to cancel orders since the waiting queue is long and time wasting. Johnny Lau, chief consulting aviation business services Pwc Hong Kong said, "it is normal for airlines
        to wait for three to five years to get their orders and the waiting time is great cost for airline companies."</p>

    <p>However, analysts' expectations failed to be proved on the ground that Garuda Indonesia has scrapped its multibillion-order of 49 Boeing 737 Max 8 jets. </p>
    <p>Several airlines are threatening to retrieve their own Boeing orders, jeopardizing the US company's US$600 billion above order book for 737 Max aircraft.
    </p>

    <p>
        Garuda said it would like to replace Max 8 jets by other Boeing jets and it was still waiting for Boeing's response at this stage.
    </p>

    <p>
        Garuda did not disclose whether it needs to pay for the cancellation fees. But the cancellation process if hard to pull off. Normally airlines have to forego their deposits which is around 5% of the purchase price, together with progress payments made
        up to two years ahead of delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other airlines are continuing to finance future MAX deliveries and valuations of the plane have not changed since the grounding.
    </p>
    <h2>Strong ties to the government gloomed its image </h2>
    <p>Boeing exacerbated its corporate image since its strong connections with the US government was revealed. Its spending on political movements is always generous, with US$15 million in 2019 and US$16.7 million in 2017 on its lobbying efforts. </p>
    <P>Patrick Michael Shanahan, the secretary of Defense in the US, used to be a senior manager in Boeing. Nikki Haley, who used to serve as United States Ambassador to the United Nations recently was nominated to join the board of Boeing.</P>

    <p>Lu said the crash is slightly tweaking Boeing's corporate image, but it will not destroy company's reputation. "Boeing has a long history in the US and there are many political factors that come into play. The connections between the government and
        Boeing may help Boeing to some extent. It is highly likely that US government may want to lend its hand to Boeing."</p>
    <P>Mary Schiavo, a former inspector-general at the transport department said Boeing always had strong relationship with the US government. "If anyone ever did anything the company did not like, they would quickly be on the receiving end of a phone call
        from one member of Congress or another." </P>
