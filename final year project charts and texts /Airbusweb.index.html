    <h1>Shift of aircraft model shuts down the superjumbo </h1>
    <p>Reporter: Jimmy Ding</p>
    <p>Luxury and huge body no longer serves the demand from airlines. That is exactly what happened to A380, the superjumbo invented by Airbus. </p>
    <p>Iran Douglas, senior lecturer in School of Aviation, University of Sydney said, "the end of A380 construction reflects airlines moving their focus to smaller wide-body aircraft such as Boeing 787 and Airbus 350."</p>
    <p>Airbus said it would stop assembling A380 in 2021, following the cancellation of a chunk of the few remaining orders for the 868-seat jet. </p>
    <iframe src="A380.html" width=100%, height=400px, frameborder='0'> </iframe>
    <p>The glory days of A380 are gone when people needed to transit at the airport and then head for their destinations. With more and more airports built in different cities, nowadays people prefer going to their final destinations directly. Another problem
        is the four-engine behemoth could incur huge oil costs. Airlines are gravitating to smaller, and economical wide-bodies such as A330 or Boeing 777.</p>
    <p>Airbus Global Market Forecast used to estimate that Airbus would deliver 1235 superjumbos to airlines wthin 19 years. However, until January 2019, Airbus only received 313 orders for the A380 and delivered 234 aircrafts.

    </p>
    <p>A380 can carry the largest number of passengers of around 868, with 538 seats on the main deck and 330 on the upper. It was lunched to carry large passengers to big airports before splitting into smaller planes on their way to their final destinations.

        <font size="1">The interior of A380 is well-funished with extensive space. </font>
    </p>
    <p>The superjumbo, priced at US$445 million but sold at steep discounts used to work well for both airlines and their customers. The A380 used to be popular among its customers. </p>
    <p>Emirates said it would take delivery of 14 further A380s over the next two years and has also ordered 70 of Airbus smaller A330 and A350 models. </p>
    <p>Emirates' chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum said "While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation." </p>
    <p>Chief executive of Airbus Tom Enders said in the statement "we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years." Although Airbus tried to revamp its A380
        to make it more efficient, the investment required seemed unviable for Airbus.

        <font size="1">Currently Emirates, the bigger customer of A380 aircraft holds 108 A380 with 54 pending delivery. </font>
    </p>
    <p>Both Airbus and Boeing should be aware of the demand for large planes has been reduced. Lackluster orders of the 777X and A380 is a warning signal for these two giants. Demand for wide-body planes has slowed following a buying spree in 2013 and 2014.
    </p>
    <p>The business of Airbus is till thriving despite A380 is wiped out of the market. Recently Airbus struck a deal with China worth around 30 billion euros, defeated Boeing's ambition on China which is trying to sell more airplanes to China through the
        US China trade deal. Boeing is restoring its trust in its own best-selling 737 Max aircraft after two crashed in five months.

    </p>

    <p>The deal is signed by the two sides coinciding with Chinese president Xi Jinping's visit in France. China Aviation Supplies Holding Company will purchase 290 A320 family jets and 10 A350 wide body jets. </p>

    <p>The competition between the two largest aircraft manufactures are still fierce and ongoing. In 2018, Boeing and Airbus announced more than US$43 billion in airline orders. Jet Airways ordered 75 737 MAX 8 jetliners which is valued at US$8.8 billion.
        Meanwhile Airbus also revealed it sold a US$8.8 billion deal to an undisclosed buyer for 80 A320 neo narrow-body jets. </p>
    <p>Boeing announced it delivered 806 jetliners for 2018, the highest record but failing to keep its promise which is to deliver 810 to 815 jets. </p>
    <p>Airbus said it delivered 800 planes in 2018, also the highest record. However, Airbus revised its goal to cut by about 20 aircraft because of supplier problems and internal production issues.
